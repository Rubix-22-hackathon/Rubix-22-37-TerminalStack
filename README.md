## WeCare - Virtual Health Assistant
The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed how outpatient
care is delivered in health care practices. To decrease the risk of
transmitting the virus to either patients or health care workers
within their practice, doctors are deferring elective and preventive
visits, such as annual physicals. Many patients are also avoiding
visits because they do not want to leave their homes and risk
exposure. Also influencing both doctors and patient behavior are
the evolving local and state recommendations restricting travel.

Build an application that helps people to monitor their health
parameters and vitals in order to live a healthy life.

Features desired in the application:
1. Video consultation with doctor
2. Book an appointment with doctor for physical visit
3. Doctors can give the prescription through the application
4. The application should save the medical history including the doctorâ€™s prescription.
5. Patients can purchase medicines from the application and book lab tests

The solution can also provide general medical assistance which will be useful in cases of emergencies.

Collaborated with a team of **4** using technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Express js**, **MySQL**, **Passport** for 
authentication, and peer js / Socket / **WebRTC** for real-time communication.
